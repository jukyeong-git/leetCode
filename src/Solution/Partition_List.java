    /*
     * Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
     * You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *  Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
     *  Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
     *
     * Example 2:
     *  Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
     *  Output: [1,2]
     *
     * Constraints:
     *  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
     *  -100 <= Node.val <= 100
     *  -200 <= x <= 200
